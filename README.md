# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-using-Tableau-and-SQL

 This project explores a hotel revenue analysis spanning across three years (2015, 2016, and 2017).
 The provided dataset contains information about hotel reservations at two types of hotels: Resort Hotels (H1) and City Hotels (H2).
 
 SQL and Tableau tools was leveraged to uncover valuable insights about revenue & guest seasonality, parking lots...

Data from raw .csv file was ingested into SQL Server Management Studio [SSMS],
from which SQL queries were iteratively built upon to obtain the final SQL output which was then imported into SSMS for data analysis &visualization which was done in Tableau.
Insight concerning Guests, revenue, seasonality, additional parking lots were revealed.

 ## Objective
The goal is to explore the dataset, identify interesting patterns, gain insights and create impactful visualizations to tell a compelling data story. 
This repository will contain my SQL script and a link to my published Tableau visuals.

## Tools used
- SQL - For Data Manipulation

- Tableau - For Data Visualization

- Github - For Documentation

  ## Step by step process
1. Importing the data : Import the hotel reservation dataset into your preferred SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL....)
2. Data exploration : Explore the dataset to better understand the variables and the relationships between them.
3. SQL Analysis : Use SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
4. Tableau Visualization : Create visualizations in Tableau based on findings from the SQL analysis and publish.
5. GitHub Repository : Maintain a GitHub repository for all scripts, code, and visualizations.
6. Tableau Dashboards publishing : Publish Tableau dashboards for easy access and sharing.
7. Presentation : Prepare a presentation or report summarizing the findings and recommendations.

### Deliverables
SQL environment with imported dataset and SQL queries.
Published tableau dashboard.
A presentation or report summarizing the findings and recommendations.
A GitHub repository with documentation and code.

### key business questions addressed in this project:
1. Which are the busiest months?
2. Is the hotel revenue growing by year?
3. Is there a need to increase the parking lot space?
4. Who are the Agents with the highest revenue?
